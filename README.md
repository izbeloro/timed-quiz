# timed-quiz

## Description

This webpage was created to present a timed quiz based on the acquired skills learned in class. This webpage contains a series of questions regarding topics of coding the class has already learned. The webpage then notifies the user wether their answer to each question is correct or incorrect. Selecting an incorrect answer results in a deduction of 5 seconds on the overall time. Once the quiz is finished, a form populates asking the user to submit their initials and time left of the score. This challenge tested the attentative quality of the student as well as giving the student a scenario they would encounter in their career.
